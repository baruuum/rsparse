\usage{
soft_impute(x, rank = 10L, lambda = 0, n_iter = 100L,
  convergence_tol = 0.001, init = NULL, final_svd = TRUE)

soft_svd(x, rank = 10L, lambda = 0, n_iter = 100L,
  convergence_tol = 0.001, init = NULL, final_svd = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{sparse matrix. Both CSR \code{dgRMatrix} and CSC \code{dgCMatrix} are supported.
CSR matrix is preffered because in this case algorithm will benefit from multithreaded
CSR * dense matrix products (if OpenMP is supported on your platform).
On many-cores machines this reduces fitting time significantly.}

\item{rank}{maximum rank of the low-rank solution.}

\item{lambda}{regularization parameter for the nuclear norm}

\item{n_iter}{maximum number of iterations of the algorithms}

\item{convergence_tol}{convergence tolerance.
Internally functions keeps track of the relative change of the Frobenious norm
of the two consequent iterations. If the change is less than \code{convergence_tol}
then the process is considered as converged and function returns result.}

\item{init}{\link{svd} like object with \code{u, v, d} components to initialize algorithm.
Algorithm benefit from warm starts. \code{init} could be rank up \code{rank} of the maximum allowed rank.
If \code{init} has rank less than max rank it will be padded automatically.}

\item{final_svd}{\code{logical} whether need to make final preprocessing with SVD.
This is not necessary but cleans up rank nicely - hithly recommnded to leave it \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\link{svd}-like object - \code{list(u, v, d)}. \code{u, v, d}
components represent left, right singular vectors and singular values.
