Description: Implements many algorithms for statistical learning on 
  sparse matrices - matrix factorizations, matrix completion, 
  elastic net regressions, factorization machines. 
  Also 'rsparse' enhances 'Matrix' package by providing methods for 
  multithreaded <sparse, dense> matrix products and native slicing of 
  the CSR matrices.
  List of the algorithms for regression problems:
  1) Elastic net regression via Follow The Proximally-Regularized leader Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  2) Factorization Machines (SGD)
  List of algorithms for matrix factorization and matrix completion:
  1) Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF) via Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
  2) Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorization (ALS)
  3) Fast Truncated SVD (ALS)
  4) Soft-Thresholded SVD (ALS)
  5) Soft-Impute matrix completion (ALS)
  6) Linear-Flow matrix factorization
  7) GlobalVectors (GloVe) matrix factorization (SGD)
  Package is reasonably fast and memory efficient - it allows to work with large
  datasets - millions of rows and millions of columns. This is particularly useful 
  for practitioners working on recommender systems.
